            <h3> was in my 10th grade when my sister joined as a freelance tester with many websites. Later, 
            she moved away from it but I picked up the flow and started learning about testing.
            Although there was no one to guide me, 
            I had to start everything from scratch and learnt all about software testing, 
            automation testing, agile testing, 
            API testing with the help of google and other resources available 
            on the internet.  </h3>
           <p> Being a software tester feels amazing. The happiness when you find a bug or your reported issues get approved is something next level. 
            I have learnt a lot of things in my 5 years of testing journey. Initially, 
            it was tough but I did it </p>
